## Getting Started

### Terms

* Dynamically-typed Languages
* IntelliSense
* Refactoring
* Source maps
* Statically-typed Languages
* Transpiling
* Type safety

## Summary

* Programming languages divide into two categories: statically-typed and dynamically-
  typed.
* In statically-typed languages (eg C++, C#, Java, etc), the type of variables is set at
  compile-time and cannot change later.
* In dynamically-typed languages (eg Python, JavaScript, Ruby), the type of variables is
  determined at run-time and can change later.
* TypeScript is essentially JavaScript with static typing and some additional features that
  help us write more concise and robust code.
* Most IDEs and code editors supporting TypeScript provide incredible IntelliSense and
  auto-completion. So we get active hints as we code. A great productivity booster!
* By providing type information in our code, we get better refactoring support in most
  IDEs and code editors.
* Refactoring means changing the structure of the code without changing its behavior.
* With TypeScript we can catch more bugs at compile time.
* Browsers don’t understand TypeScript code. So we need to use the TypeScript compiler
  to compile and translate (or transpile) our TypeScript code into regular JavaScript for
  execution by browsers.
* Source maps are files that represent the mapping between TypeScript and JavaScript
  code. They’re used for debugging.
* We can configure the TypeScript compiler by enabling/disabling various settings in
  tsconfig.json.
